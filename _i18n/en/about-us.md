My name is Alex and I have traveled for my studies and for business. I am currently back in France with the objective of living the expat life again later. Once you have tasted the expat life, it's hard to stop!

I want to share my experience (and my friends's experience) about what it's like to live abroad and all the personal benefits you can get from it. And to get the most out of this experience, a few tips to avoid the big problems.

If you want to say "hi" do not hesitate to send me an email (<alex@alfonse.eu>). I reply every email that comes my way and expats have the reputation of helping each other...
