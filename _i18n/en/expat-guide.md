There are many reasons to go abroad, and all of them are good ones. The most frequent ones are your career, learning a language, love or money. Sometimes, multiple reasons at the same time. One advice, write it down on a piece of paper and read it time and again to stay motivated.

Because moving abroad is not a piece of cake. It is not something we do a lot, and missing a step can have annoying consequences. So you want to make sure you did not miss anything and this guide is the right place to start.


### Status of your project
Where are you in your expatiation? If it's only a vague idea, you have time and your first step is to make your project more concrete to make sure it doesn't vanish into thin air. Set a deadline to pick when and where you want to go.

If the timing and the location are already set, then it's time to look at logistics. Some steps can require a minimum amount of time so be sure to start early and plan ahead.

You are already abroad and you need to jump on the bandwagon? I don't blame you as it has happened to me multiple times. Now it's time to put everything in order.

### Administrative tasks
Visa! (and a passeport if don't have one already)

As soon as you know where you go, get information about whether you need a visa and if you do, which one and how long does it take to get it. Sometimes, you won't have a definitive answer about the time needed to get your visa (between 2 weeks and 3 months); use the worst-case scenario and plan it from here.

Do you plan on driving abroad? If you do, make sure your driving license is valid in the country in which you will settle or do what's required to be able to drive there.

### Money
At the risk of souding too materialistic, money can be a big deal during an expatriation.

Of course, it will depend on where you are from, your professional situation, how much savings you have (and are ready to spend on your experience), and where you go and your standards of living.

I strongly advice doing an estimation of how much you will spend when you live abroad. 

#### Taxes
> In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.
<cite>Benjamin Franklin</cite>

Old Ben was right and even if you move abroad, taxes will follow. Depending on your home and target country, you may have a good surprise and pay only a fraction of the taxes you would have paid if you stayed or you may pay double. 
In both cases, have a look at tax rules in both countries and keep a postal address in your home country to avoid bad surprises.

### Accomodation

#### Finding a new home
Looking for a place to live can be a challenge in many (big) cities, especially if you live far, do not know the city and are a foreigner.

If you travel for business purposes, use whatever help your company can provide to find a flat (financial help, a few nights in a hotel, support from a local real-estate agent...). If you travel for personal reasons, use your network to get local help for finding a flat or spend some time on the internet to understand how renting works there (hint: it can be radically different from how it works in your country).


#### Moving
The first advice here is to move only what you absolutely need. Most of the time, that doesn't include clothes and other basic items that you can buy everywhere - and even cheaper if you're moving to a country where life is cheaper than home.
If you have a pet, that will mean an extra challenge but it's worth it. Find out about whether and how you can get your companion to this new country.

If you have to move more than two bags per person, you probably need to hire a company to move your stuff. You can find good moving services on the internet but it requires a bit of planning to collect your belongings in due time.


### Family
If you travel alone, good news for you on this point: life will be much easier.
If you travel with your significant other, be sure to be aligned on how long the expatriation will last and what it brings to both persons in the couple. 

One important thing, if the expatriation is for professional reasons, discuss whether the other one wants/should find another job there. If that's the case, which visa do you need and what are the criteria to get it? Is it easy to get a job for you there? Dust your résumé off, translate it if needed and think about being accompanied in your job search.

If you don't plan on finding a job there, think of what you will do. Write a blog, build your own company, be involved in associations, ...? Be clear about it and find something because "visiting the city" will only get you excited for a couple of weeks.

If children are coming with you, that will be a great experience for them as well. However, you have to find a school there and whatever childcare you need.


### Health
The first thing that comes to mind is vaccines, and rightfully so.

But it's not the only thing to take care of before the big day. Look at your future country's healthcare system: some are very good and cover foreigners under specific conditions. Other healthcare systems are less developed and/or generous; in this case, a private insurance is a must-have. You cannot really negotiate going to the hospital when you have a broken leg or worse.

Another thing related to your social protection is pension. How long will you be abroad and what are the impact on your future pension? Chances are retirement is far from you but it will be a big deal in a few years. So be nice to the "future you" and at least be clear on the impacts of this experience for later.


### Holidays
This one is a good one, at least you know how to take advantage of it.
If your family stay back "home", they will ask you to come back whenever you have a few days off. Is it something you are comfortable with?

If not, make it clear and plan your future vacations to have good balance. Ask your closed ones to come and visit you as well. That way you get to see them, they get to travel and it will help you with home-sickness. It's a win-win!


### Phew, that's a lot...
Yes, but ask any expatriate and she will tell you it's worth it.

Remember, you wrote the reason(s) why you want to go abroad - or you didn't, but you do have to do it now ;). 

Also, there are things that you can control and others that you cannot. In the first case, there is nothing to worry about and in the second case worrying is useless...
Transition periods are always frustrating, especially when it's filled with administrative and other unsexy topics. But the more you handle those things before, the more you will enjoy your life when you get there.

So keep going, and [reach out to me]({% tl contact_us %}) if you need any advice or just a moral bump.
